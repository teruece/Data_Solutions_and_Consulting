# Data & AI Strategy Delivery for Nana Online Grocery & In-Stores

## Project Overview
I led a **data and AI consulting project** for Nana, a mid-sized grocery retailer operating in the Middle East with both **e-commerce and in-store channels**.  

The client had invested in various cloud technologies but lacked a **unified view of customers and sales**, and their analytics team spent most of their time on manual reporting.  

The CEO wanted to leverage **AI to personalize customer experiences and improve sales forecasting**.

## Business Challenges

During my assessment, I identified several key issues:

- **Fragmented Data Sources**: POS, e-commerce platform (Shopify/Magento), CRM/loyalty program, inventory, and finance systems were siloed.  
- **Manual Reporting Bottlenecks**: Analytics team spent ~70% of their time consolidating reports.  
- **Limited AI Readiness**: Historical data was inconsistent and incomplete; no standardized pipelines or quality framework existed.

**Impact on the business**:  

- Inaccurate sales forecasting and inventory management  
- Poor customer segmentation and targeting  
- Delayed business decisions due to inconsistent KPIs

## My Data & AI Strategy

I designed a **cloud-first, phased strategy** to address both the immediate pain points and long-term AI enablement goals:

1. **Cloud-First Architecture**
   - Consolidated all data into a **Azure Data Lakehouse** (Data Lake Gen2 + Databricks)  
   - Modular ingestion pipelines for each source (POS, CRM, e-commerce, ERP)  
   - Incremental and batch loading for efficiency

2. **Data Governance & Quality**
   - Defined **Data Owner** and **Data Steward** roles  
   - Implemented **data quality scoring and monitoring**  
   - Embedded **GDPR/PCI compliance** with masking, access control, and metadata tracking

3. **AI & Analytics Enablement**
   - **Phase 1:** Predictive sales forecasting using historical POS and e-commerce data  
   - **Phase 2:** Customer segmentation for personalized promotions  
   - **Phase 3:** AI-driven recommendation engine for online shoppers

4. **Self-Service Dashboards & Adoption**
   - Delivered **Power BI dashboards** for operations, marketing, and finance  
   - Conducted training and workshops to upskill internal teams
