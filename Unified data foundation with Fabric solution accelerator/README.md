# Unified data foundation with Fabric solution accelerator

This solution accelerator provides a unified data foundation with integrated data architecture leveraging Microsoft Fabric, OneLake, Microsoft Purview, and Azure Databricks to deliver a unified, integrated, and governed analytics platform.

Built with principles of [medallion lakehouse architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-medallion-lakehouse-architecture), the solution accelerator supports data mesh concepts with a sample implementation. It provides domain schemas and sample data as a framework for shared domains (customer, product), finance, and sales across multiple channels. You can easily adopt the framework and update the domain models with your own. The solution seamlessly integrates sales channel data hosted in Azure Databricks, utilizing Fabric's data mirroring and shortcut to bring this data into the gold tier for unified analytics and reporting. Pre-built Power BI dashboards showcase advanced sales analytics. Advanced data governance is powered by Microsoft Purview, ensuring compliance and transparency.

This solution accelerator demonstrates how organizations can unify, govern, and analyze data across multiple domains and platforms using modern lakehouse architecture and robust governance, enabling rapid development of analytics solutions for diverse business needs.

We have built flexibility and options so that you do not have to provision all three platforms (Microsoft Fabric, Microsoft Purview, and Azure Databricks) all at once. Please see details in the Solution Overview section below for more details.

**Key use cases include:**

- Unified data platform uses Microsoft Fabric as core architecture components, with choices for integration with other platforms
- Customer and product master data management (data models, source file processing, data validation, consolidations)
- Sales analytics across data stored in Fabric and Azure Databricks
- Finance data management and foundation for reporting
- Power BI dashboards for sales data with actionable business insights

Solution overview
</h2>
We have built a flexible and configurable architecture with plug-and-play options, providing you with four architecture choices. You can deploy any of the following four architectures based on your organizational needs:


1. **Core Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric only**
2. **Core Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric + Microsoft Purview**
3. **Core Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric + Azure Databricks**
4. **Core Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric + Microsoft Purview + Azure Databricks**

For a detailed feature description of each architecture option, please refer to [Solution Architecture and Options](./docs/TechnicalArchitecture.md).

### Solution architecture

The architecture below illustrates the solution architecture built with option 4.

|                                                          |

### How to customize
If you'd like to customize the solution accelerator, here are some common areas to start:

You can modify the data models and notebooks in different folders under the `src` folder. Please note if any part is modified, you will need to modify the associated parts accordingly, as the data model (schemas and tables), notebooks, Power BI semantic models, Power BI dashboards, and sample data are a cohesive set of resources working together as designed. 

[Customize Schema](./src/fabric/notebooks/schema)

[Update Data Management Notebooks](./src/fabric/notebooks/data_management)

[Update Bronze to Silver Data Processing Notebooks](./src/fabric/notebooks/bronze_to_silver)

[Update Silver to Gold Data Processing Notebooks](./src/fabric/notebooks/silver_to_gold)

[Update Runner Notebooks if Notebooks have been added or dropped](./src/fabric/notebooks)

<h2><img src="./docs/images/readme/business-scenario.png" width="48" />
Business use case
</h2>
After successful deployment of the Core Medallion Architecture in Microsoft Fabric, the Fabric workspace will be your main UI where you can access the lakehouses, PySpark data processing and data management notebooks, and Power BI semantic models, and integration with Azure Databricks if you have chosen option 3. If you choose option 1, no Databricks folder will be created. Both data engineer and sales analyst roles will be using the same Fabric workspace to perform their tasks. The diagram below illustrates the data engineer UI. Sales analysts will be able to use the Power BI semantic models and dashboards within the folder named `reports`.  Use cases can be summarized as below:

- Data Engineer creates or updates PySpark notebooks to complete data processing and data management tasks
- Data Engineer creates or updates T-SQL scripts to manage the data using Fabric SQL End Points
- Data Engineer tests end-to-end data flow
- Sales Analysts create or update Power BI Semantic models based off Gold tier lakehouse
- Sales Analysts create or update Power BI dashboards.

<br/>

The data engineer can also upload additional source data to the bronze lakehouse and recreate the data processing flow from bronze to silver and then to gold. 

⚠️ The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Python Programs. The data is intended for use as sample data only.
